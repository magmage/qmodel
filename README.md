Installation
====

The qmodel package can be installed with pip from a local clone of the
repository. From within this directory, simply run
```sh
pip install .
```
Optionally one can install with the `-e` (`--editable`) flag to let changes in
the source code take effect without having to perform a fresh install. The
command for this would be
```sh
pip install -e .
```

To uninstall, run
```sh
pip uninstall qmodel
```
You may need to be in another directory than this one for the command to work.
